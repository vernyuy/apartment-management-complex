This course will teach you how to build a graphql api for an apartment complex management system using AWS Serverless Technology and implement CICD with github and AWS CodePipeline.

You will learn how to use 
- AWS Lambda, 
- Amazon Cognito, 
- Amazon DynamoDB, 
- Amazon SQS,
- Javascript resolver,
- CodePipeline for CICD
- Graphql codegen to generate TypeScript types from your GraphQL schema. This means you can have type-safe access to your schema's types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions directly in your TypeScript code.
- and AWS AppSync to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective system for managing your apartment complex.


## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the benefits of using AWS Serverless Technology to build scalable GraphQL APIs.
- Design and implement an AWS Serverless Technology solution.
- Use AWS Lambda to create serverless functions for handling common tasks.
- Use Amazon SQS for queueing and decoupling applications.
- Use Amazon Cognito to authenticate and authorize users.
- Use Amazon DynamoDB to store data about your apartment complex.
- Explore to power to javascript resolvers over lambda resolvers.
