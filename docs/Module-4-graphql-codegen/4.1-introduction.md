## Strongly typed Appsync resolvers.

 Javascript resolver is a serverless function that you write in JavaScript (or TypeScript) to handle the logic for resolving GraphQL queries, mutations, or subscriptions. 

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. Together with GraphQL, which is also typed, they are the perfect duo.

### Here is what we'd like to achieve:

- Auto-generation of TypeScript types from a GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language)

- Use the generated types along with generic AppSync types in resolver handlers

- Transpile and bundle TypeScript into valid AppSync JavaScript code (APPSYNC_JS runtime)

- Deploy an AppSync API with the TypeScript CDK


Let's get started.
