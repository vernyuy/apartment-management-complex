## Install the dependencies

We will need to install three packages:

`npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript -D
`

## Create the configuration file

It's time to configure graphql-codegen and tell it how to generate our TS types. For that, we'll create a `codegen.ts` file in our project's root directory:

```
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli';

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  overwrite: true,
  schema: [
    'schema/schema.graphql',
    `
scalar AWSDate
scalar AWSTime
scalar AWSDateTime
scalar AWSTimestamp
scalar AWSEmail
scalar AWSJSON
scalar AWSURL
scalar AWSPhone
scalar AWSIPAddress
`,
  ],
  config: {
    scalars: {
      AWSJSON: 'string',
      AWSDate: 'string',
      AWSTime: 'string',
      AWSDateTime: 'string',
      AWSTimestamp: 'number',
      AWSEmail: 'string',
      AWSURL: 'string',
      AWSPhone: 'string',
      AWSIPAddress: 'string',
    },
  },
  generates: {
    'src/types/appsync.ts': {
      plugins: ['typescript'],
    },
  },
};

export default config;

```

This tells codegen which schema file(s) it should use (in the example: schema.graphql), what plugin (typescript) and where the output should be placed (appsync.d.ts). Fell free to change these parameters to match your needs.


If you are using special AWS AppSync Scalars, you will also need to tell graphql-codegen how to handle them.

>ðŸ’¡ You need to declare, at the minimum, the scalars that you use, but it might be a good idea to just declare them all and forget about it.


## Generate the code
We are all set with the configuration. Time to generate some code! Run the following command:

```
graphql-codegen
```
>ðŸ’¡ You can also add "codegen": "graphql-codegen" to you package.json under the "scripts" section, and use npm run codegen.

If you look in `src/types/` directory, you should now see an `appsync.ts` file that contains your generated types.
