## Configure codePipeline

Within the `lib/acms-stack.ts` file,

Import the required constructs.

```ts
import {
  CodePipeline,
  ShellStep,
  CodePipelineSource,
} from "aws-cdk-lib/pipelines";
```

Within your stack constructor, define a CodePipeline resource.

```ts
new CodePipeline(this, "Pipeline", {
      synth: new ShellStep("synth", {
        input: CodePipelineSource.gitHub(
          "<github-name>/<repo-name>",
          "<branch-name>"
        ),
        commands: ["npm ci", "npm run build", "npx cdk synth"],
      }),
    });

```
Let's look into the code

Inside the stack constructor, a CodePipeline resource is defined. 

- The `synth` property specifies the synthesis step of the pipeline. In this case, it is a `ShellStep` named "synth".
    - The `input` property specifies the source of the pipeline, which is a GitHub repository. You need to replace `<github-name>/<repo-name>` with the actual GitHub username and repository name, and `<branch-name>` with the desired branch name.
    - The `commands` property specifies the commands to be executed during the synthesis step. In this workshop, it runs `npm ci` to install dependencies, `npm run build` to build the project, and `npx cdk synth` to synthesize the AWS CloudFormation template.

    Run the command `cdk deploy` in your terminal to connect the GitHub repository and the AWS account. The resources required by CodePipeline will be automatically created.

Commit your changes your changes and push the code to GitHub.

> At this point, deploy your cdk application withe the command `cdk deploy` for AWS to create the communication between your application repository and the cdk application.
