In this module, we'll see how to write `appsync javascript resolvers` in `typescript`.

These are serverless functions that are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) to handle the logic for resolving GraphQL queries, mutations, or subscriptions. 

These resolvers are the backbone of a GraphQL API, as they define how to fetch or modify data in response to GraphQL operations.
