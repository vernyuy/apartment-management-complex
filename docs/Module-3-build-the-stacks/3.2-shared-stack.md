### ACMS Stack

In this stack construct, we are going to provision the following infrastructure resources

- Cognito UserPool
- AppSync GraphQL Api
- DynamoDb Table
- CloudWatch and DynamoDB role managed Policies.

Inside `acms-stack.ts` file located in `lib` folder, we’ll define constructs for the above resources.

And because we’ll be using the resources in other stacks, we have to expose the resources somehow. 

We’ll see that in a bit.

### Codepipeline


```jsx
/**
 * Codepipeline and deployment stages
 */
const pipeline = new CodePipeline(this, "acms-pipeline", {
      synth: new ShellStep("synth", {
        input: CodePipelineSource.gitHub(
          "vernyuy/apartment-management-complex",
          "main"
        ),
        commands: ["npm ci", "npm run build", "npx cdk synth"],
      }),
    });

    /*********************************
     *    Add dev stage
     *********************************/
    const devStage = pipeline.addStage(
      new PipelineStage(this, "PipelineDevStage", {
        stageName: "dev",
      })
    );
```
