## Building Stack

The building stack follows the same process of creation like the user stack.

Here’s the building endpoint we will be creating.

```tsx
createBuilding(input: BuildingInput!): Building!
    @aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: ["Admins"])
```

A building can only be created by

- A logged in User
- The User has to belong to the `Admins` group.

Inside the `lib` folder, create a file named `building-lambda-stack.ts`.

At the top of the `building-lambda-stack.ts` file, create an interface which extends `StackProps` and define the 3 resources we intend importing from the main stack.

```tsx
interface BuildingLambdaStackProps extends StackProps {
  acmsGraphqlApi: appsync.GraphqlApi;
  acmsDatabase: Table;
}
```

Then the Building stack looks like this

```tsx
export class BuildingLamdaStacks extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: BuildingLambdaStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const { acmsDatabase, acmsGraphqlApi, apiSchema } = props;
  }
}
```

Let’s go ahead and define our appsync function, resolver and datasource.

### Appsync function

```ts
const buildingFunction = new appsync.AppsyncFunction(this, "createBuilding", {
  name: "createBuilding",
  api: acmsGraphqlApi,
  dataSource: acmsGraphqlApi.addDynamoDbDataSource(
    "acmsBuildingDataSource",
    acmsDatabase
  ),
  code: bundleAppSyncResolver("src/resolvers/building/createBuilding.ts"),
  runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
});
```

### Resolver

```ts
new appsync.Resolver(this, "createBuildingResolver", {
  api: acmsGraphqlApi,
  typeName: "Mutation",
  fieldName: "createBuilding",
  code: appsync.Code.fromAsset(
    join(__dirname, "./js_resolvers/_before_and_after_mapping_template.js")
  ),
  runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
  pipelineConfig: [buildingFunction],
});
```

Don’t forget to add the building stack to your `pipeline-stack` like so

```tsx
export class PipelineStage extends Stage {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StageProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const acmsSharedStack = new AcmsSharedStack(this, "AcmsSharedStack");

    new UserLamdaStacks(this, "UserLambdaStacks", {
      acmsDatabase: acmsSharedStack.acmsDatabase,
      acmsGraphqlApi: acmsSharedStack.acmsGraphqlApi,
    });

    new BuildingLamdaStacks(this, "BuildingLambdaStacks", {
      acmsDatabase: acmsSharedStack.acmsDatabase,
      acmsGraphqlApi: acmsSharedStack.acmsGraphqlApi,
    });
  }
}
```
