This course will teach you how to build a graphql API with JavaScript resolvers for an apartment complex management system with enhanced type safety, using AWS Serverless Technology and implementing CICD with Git Hub and AWS CodePipeline.


You will learn how to use 
- AWS Lambda, 
- Amazon Cognito, 
- Amazon DynamoDB, 
- Amazon SQS,
- Javascript resolver,
- CodePipeline for CICD
- Graphql codegen to generate TypeScript types from your GraphQL schema. This means you can have type-safe access to your schema's types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions directly in your TypeScript code.
- and AWS AppSync to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective system for managing your apartment complex.


## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the benefits of using AWS Serverless Technology to build scalable GraphQL APIs.
- Design and implement an AWS Serverless Technology solution.
- Use AWS Lambda to create serverless functions for handling common tasks.
- Use Amazon SQS for queueing and decoupling applications.
- Use Amazon Cognito to authenticate and authorize users.
- Use Amazon DynamoDB to store data about your apartment complex.
- Explore the power of javascript resolvers over lambda resolvers.
- Use codegen to generate types for the graphql schema.
