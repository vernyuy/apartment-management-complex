In the `lib` directory, create a new file and name it `pipeline-stage.ts`.

Add the following code to the created file.

```tsx
import { SharedStack } from "./shared-stack";
import { Stage, StageProps } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";

export class PipelineStage extends Stage {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StageProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    /***********************************
     *    Instantiate the shared stack
     ***********************************/
    new SharedStack(this, "sharedStack", {
      stageName: props?.stageName as string,
    });
  }
}
```

We define a class named `PipelineStage` that extends the `Stage` class.

- The `PipelineStage` class has a constructor that takes in `scope`, `id`, and `props` as parameters.

- Inside the constructor, it calls the constructor of the `Stage` class using `super(scope, id, props)`.

- It instantiates a new `SharedStack` by calling `new SharedStack(this, "sharedStack", { stageName: props?.stageName as string })`.

- The `stageName` property is passed as a parameter to the `SharedStack` constructor.

- The `SharedStack` is defined in a separate file named `shared-stack.ts`.

- The `PipelineStage` class is exported to be used in other parts of the workshop.
