```tsx
const prodStage = pipeline.addStage(
      new PipelineStage(this, "PipelineProdStage", {
        stageName: "prod",
      })
    );
```

The code block adds a production stage to a pipeline. It creates an instance of the `PipelineStage` class with the name "PipelineProdStage" and the stage name "prod". This stage is then added to the pipeline using the `addStage` method.
